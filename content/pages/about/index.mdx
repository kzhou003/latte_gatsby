:wave: Welcome to Latte:coffee: Bytes:computer:, my digital domain, \
Where I, Kuan, a physicist turned machine learning engineer, try to explain, \
My passions for science, artificial intelligence, and photography too, \
From the Bay Area, where I live with my wife:woman: and a feline:cat2:, named Gemma, who is quite a muse.

I don't know it all, but I'll share what I've learned, \
In hopes to inspire, and perhaps have you turned, \
To a new passion or project, or maybe a smile, \
To make it all worth it, and make it all worthwhile. 

A new addition is coming, a baby girl:girl: this summer, \
My heart fills with joy, to welcome another member, \
To our little family, and to this blog of mine, \
Where I hope to share with you, some great stories and finds. 

So grab a cup of latte, and join me for a while, \
As I share with you, some fun stuff and all that's worthwhile.
